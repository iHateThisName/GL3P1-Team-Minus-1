      - Hey. It's good to see you.
      - Thanks a lot for coming down here.
      - I know how hard it is.
      - But you're lucky. The weather is nice. Perfect for diving.
      - You know what you need.
      - The treasures are down there. Scattered all around.
      - You just need to get them.
      - Remember what I taught you about breathing.
      - Breathe in, hold, breathe out.
      - That's the magic behind it.
      - Keep your breathing steady and keep an eye on your oxygen.
      - ...
      - Tell you what, I'll give you a little practice.
      - Just go into the water, and bring me the first treasure you find.
      - I'll explain the rest when you come back.
      - Good luck.
    - dialogLines:
      - Great!
      - If you go to the shop, you'll be able to sell the items you collected.
      - And then use the money you get from that to upgrade your suit.
      - Upgrading allows you to go deeper into the ocean.
      - And at the bottom, you'll find it. The final treasure.
      - It'll be difficult. But as long as you keep an eye on your oxygen, you should
        be safe.
      - If you see that your oxygen is getting low, swim straight up.
      - Don't be reckless and go further than you can handle.
      - I don't want to see you get hurt.
      - But...
      - If you get into trouble, get stuck...
      - I'll come get you. Pull you out.
      - Just don't rush yourself.
      - Take one step at a time.
      - I'll let you go now.
      - I'll always be here though, if you need someone to talk to.
      - Oh, and by the way.
      - Treasures weigh you down. Some more than others.
      - They make it more difficult for you to breathe.
      - Just be careful.
      - If I have to come pull you out, I'll have to leave the treasures behind.
      - And some treasures...
      - They may be difficult for you.
      - But, that's why we're here. You can't get to the bottom if you don't deal
        with the difficult treasures.
      - Well, I'll see you later.
      - Best of luck.
    - dialogLines:
      - Wow.
      - You found one already. I can only imagine how difficult it was to pull it
        out.
      - But you managed.
      - These types of treasures sell for much more at the shop.
      - You'll probably need all of them in order to buy the suit upgrades you need.
      - But don't pick those treasures if you can't handle it.
      - It's a bad idea to deal with them if you're not prepared.
      - You should have enough money now to buy the first upgrade.
      - Just come back when you've bought it.
    - dialogLines:
      - Hey, it looks good on you!
      - You should be able to get into the deeper layers of the ocean now.
      - If you follow the ocean floor, you should come to a massive drop down.
      - If you follow the slope, you should come to a cave.
      - Inside the cave's roof is an air bubble, so you can catch your breath.
      - The air bubble let's you get back to the surface very quickly.
      - And once you find an air bubble, you'll be able to use the sign next to the
        shop to travel there again.
      - It's all very quick and easy.
      - Saves you a ton of oxygen and time.
      - There's a few of these air bubbles scattered around the caves.
      - So don't worry if you feel intimidated by the depth.
      - You can travel quickly to and from.
      - So, good luck.
    - dialogLines:
      - You alright?
      - I was worried that you might have pushed yourself too far.
      - Had to pull you out of there quickly.
      - But, it seem to be alright.
      - I know it must be frustrating. Starting over again.
      - Must be exhausting. It's a long way down to the bottom.
      - But you'll get there eventually.
      - I know it's tempting to just jump in there. "Get it over with".
      - But please.
      - Be careful. Take your time.
      - Being reckless won't help you.
      - You have to face the depths, no matter what you do.
      - Otherwise you'll be stuck up here for the rest of your life.
      - So whenever your oxygen starts getting low.
      - Get yourself to safety.
      - Can you do that?
    - dialogLines:
      - Does your mother know about...
      - You know...
      - All this?
      - ...
      - Not so, huh?
      - I know you don't like talking about her all that much.
      - How long has it been since you spoke with her?
      - ...
      - Sorry.
      - I won't pry.
    - dialogLines:
      - I know you're not much for big groups and all, but I was thinking.
      - Me and a few of my friends are going on a skiing trip next month.
      - We rented two small cabins up in the mountains and stay there for a few days.
      - I know you've never been much for group events and whatnot.
      - But think about it, okay?
      - She won't hurt you when you're with us.
    - dialogLines:
      - ...
      - I can't pretend to know exactly what happened between you two.
      - But what happened wasn't your fault.
      - Don't blame yourself for the choices of others.
      - I know it affects you a lot these days.
      - And I know my words won't change what happened.
      - But don't let the past drag you down.
      - Main thing is to keep your head straight and move forward.
    - dialogLines:
      - I felt it too.
      - The presence.
      - There was a time where I felt like you do.
      - When the sight of a stranger terrified me.
      - My body shaking at the least sign of trouble.
      - That voice in the back of my head telling me that something will go wrong.
      - All the worst pain in the world couldn't commpare to the pain that the presence
        gave me.
      - There are days where it feels like it'll swarm you, drown you in that void.
      - You'll feel like the world will never have color again.
      - But listen to me carefully.
      - No matter how hard you fight it, no matter how hard you ignore it.
      - It'll always be there.
      - Somewhere, in the back of your mind.
      - Not being able to get rid of it made me feel pathetic.
      - I couldn't understand why something so small wouldn't go away.
      - But a good friend of mine helped me get through it.
      - If you can't fight it, or get rid of it.
      - Then the best you can do is to accept it.
      - Live with it.
      - I know it's hard.
      - But please.
      - Live.
